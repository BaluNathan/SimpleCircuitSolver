# SimpleCircuitSolver

This is a simple C++ program which can solve resistor-network circuits.

The circuit network is implemented through a linked list data structure, and are solved using the iterative Gauss-Seidel algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.

The following are valid commands:

insertR <i>name resistance node1 node2 </i>

-->insert a resistor of specified resistance value with the given name to endpoints node1 and node2

modifyR <i>name resistance</i>

-->modify an existing resistor with specified name to the specified resistance value

deleteR <i>all</i>
deleteR <i>name</i>

-->the deleteR command can either be used to delete all resistors or delete a specified resistor

printR <i>name</i>

-->print the named resistor

printNode <i>nodeNumber</i>
printNode <i>all</i>

-->print the specified node or all nodes

setV <i>voltage</i> <i>nodeNumber</i>

-->set specified node to specified voltage ~ corresponds to inserting voltage source at that node

unsetV <i>nodeNumber</i>

-->unset any previously set voltage at specified node

solve

-->will solve for node voltages at every node that does not have a set voltage
